# PDB-2-Lattice

PDB2LatticePy is a novel software tool designed for transforming intricate protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) into simplified lattice configurations. This program aims to reduce the computational burden in analyzing protein structures by converting detailed models into more manageable forms, like cubic or tetrahedral lattices. By doing so, it retains essential structural features while making large-scale computations and machine learning applications more feasible. PDB2LatticePy bridges the gap between complex biological data and computational efficiency, proving invaluable in fields like structural biology, bioinformatics, and drug discovery, where detailed protein analysis is crucial but computationally demanding.

## Goal

The goal of PDB2LatticePy is to create lattice representations of protein structures, which is a strategic approach to address the computational challenges in structural biology. It balances the need for simplification with the retention of critical structural features, offers flexibility in lattice configurations, enables advanced computational studies, and enhances accessibility and collaboration in the scientific community.
